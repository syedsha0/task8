Task 8 Report: VPN Setup & Suspicious Extensions

Objective:

Understand the role of VPNs in protecting privacy and securing communication. Gain hands-on experience by setting up a free VPN and evaluating suspicious browser extensions.

 VPN Setup & Verification:
 
Steps Taken:

1.Selected VPN: Chose ProtonVPN (Free Tier) for its no-log policy and good reputation.

2.Installed Client: Downloaded and installed ProtonVPN desktop app from protonvpn.com.

3.Account Setup: Signed up for a free account and verified email.

4.Connected to VPN: Connected to the nearest free server (Netherlands).

5.Verified IP Change: Checked IP at whatismyipaddress.com – confirmed change.

6.Checked Encryption: Used HTTPS websites and confirmed secure (lock icon in address bar).

7.Disconnected & Compared Speed: Browsed with and without VPN – noted a slight decrease in speed.

 VPN Encryption & Privacy :

Using a VPN is like building a secure tunnel between your device and the internet. It hides what you're doing online and keeps your data safe — just like how curtains give you privacy at home.

What Is Encryption in a VPN?
-Encryption means turning your data into secret code, so even if someone intercepts it, they can’t read it.

-Most VPNs use AES-256 encryption, which is the same level of security used by banks and the military. It’s super strong and nearly impossible to crack.

-Some newer VPNs use ChaCha20, which is fast and secure, especially on mobile phones.

-VPNs also use keys (like digital locks) to safely send and receive data.

 How VPNs Send Data: Protocols
VPN protocols are the rules that decide how your data travels through the tunnel.

Here's a simple look:

Protocol	                  Good For	                     Why It Matters
OpenVPN	                   Almost everything	            Very secure, reliable
WireGuard                 	Phones, fast connections     	Super fast and secure
IKEv2	                     Mobile users	                 Reconnects easily if Wi-Fi drops
L2TP	                      Older setups	                 Not as safe as others
PPTP	                      Avoid this	                   Outdated and not secure

Privacy Features You Should Know:

-A good VPN doesn't just hide your IP — it has tools that protect you better:

1.No-Log Policy: The VPN doesn't keep records of what websites you visit.

2.Kill Switch: If the VPN suddenly stops, your internet cuts off to prevent leaks.

3.DNS Leak Protection: Makes sure your real location/IP doesn’t accidentally slip out.

4.Split Tunneling: Choose which apps use VPN (e.g., browser yes, YouTube no).

5.Double VPN: Routes your traffic through 2 countries for extra privacy.

6.Stealth Mode: Helps you use VPN even where it's blocked (like schools or countries with censorship).

Summary: VPN Benefits & Limitations

Benefits.	                                              Limitations.

Encrypts internet traffic	                              Slightly slower speed
Hides original IP address                              	Some free VPNs have limited servers
Protects against local surveillance                    	Doesn’t ensure complete anonymity
Bypasses geo-restrictions                              	Can be blocked by some websites


 Conclusion:
 
This task helped understand the fundamentals of VPNs, their real-world applications in privacy, and the importance of identifying potentially malicious browser extensions.
